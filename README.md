# Robot-Game

A game where the user inputs number of robots (in the shape of tubular snakes) and size of grid (e.g. 10x10). Then the game is initialized and the robots continue their journey through randomly generated coordinates on the grid (left, right, up, down) and increase in their length everytime they move. The game ends when robots collide, robots collide with themselves, or when they are trapped.
